Map is stored as a 2D array


	Method #1
Making the map
choose a random point as a map as a starting seed location.
Check the adjacent squares and check if something is there.
Make multiple lsquares around the origional point
Random values for growing vertically and horizontally.
For roads random point on each for directions
Dijkstra's algorithim: Shortest path algorithim to find paths through grass.

	Method #2
1.Start with seed location
2. fixed size seed grass locations 
3. clearings overide grass
4. pick 4 random points on edges
pick random point along x axis
trace from random point x axis to other exit y axis and trace along x axis to second exit point.
One exit in each direction

Chose a center 
choose x+y dimension
place eahc reason 
later regions get priority 
decide how to use unallocated space 

Roads
Choose pads
choise random points in between
connect the dots



How to print in terminal.

5 Different clearings 
5 Different grass regions
